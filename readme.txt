=============================================
 
 UOEncryption was created as an open source library to expose Ultima Online client and server encryption scheme. It's the final result of long years of research by me and many others.

 This is the first project to have completely reverse engineered UO's encryption including the MD5 scheme.

 Off the top of my head (it's been so long) I leave thanks to Beosil, Infidel, chiphead-net, Folko, Arog, Roma, Yokozuna, Grin and many others that I do not remember, especially all the people at POL and Sphere development.

 This is the final project I'm uploading in this open source repository for Ultima Online. The only project missing is Lord Binary's Ya MuU (Yet another Multi-UO http://web.archive.org/web/20080214144803/http://uo.pspace.at/Ya_muU.htm ).

 I hope all of this is useful since it is long overdue.

 This tool along with UOCH (C version) and IRW can be found in the original repository at http://necrotoolz.sourceforge.net
